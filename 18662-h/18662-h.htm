<h1>THE TALE OF BUSTER BUMBLEBEE</h1>
<h2>I<br/>THE BIG FAMILY</h2>
</div>

<p>When Mrs. Field Mouse moved from her home in Farmer Green's meadow to
the more fashionable neighborhood near the gristmill, she had no idea
that anyone would care to live in the little old house that she had
left.</p>

<p>So she was much surprised, the following summer, when she heard that a
new family was occupying her former home.</p>

<p>"If it's a small family they'll get along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> well enough," she remarked to
Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who had told her the news.</p>

<p>"Small!" Aunt Polly exclaimed, lifting both her hands (with the black
mitts on them) high in the air. "They say it's a dreadful big family&mdash;at
least two hundred of 'em, so I've been told."</p>

<p>Well, for a moment Mrs. Field Mouse couldn't say a word, she was so
astonished. Then she managed to gasp:</p>

<p>"What's their name?"</p>

<p>"I declare, I can't just remember," said Aunt Polly Woodchuck. "But it's
a name that rhymes with <i>apple tree</i>&mdash;though that's not quite it....
They're a very musical family, I understand. My nephew, Billy Woodchuck,
passed right by their door only yesterday; and he says he heard music
and the sound of dancing from inside the house."</p>

<p>"Two hundred of them dancing in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> little house!" cried Mrs. Field
Mouse. "Why, it's positively dangerous! I should think they'd trample
one another."</p>

<p>And Aunt Polly Woodchuck agreed, before she went off towards her home
under the hill, that there were queer goings-on over there in the
meadow.</p>

<p>Later she sent her nephew Billy to tell Mrs. Field Mouse that on her way
home she had remembered the name of the big family. It was <i>Bumblebee</i>.</p>

<p>"They must be an odd lot," Mrs. Field Mouse remarked to her husband.
"Farmer Green's meadow is becoming more unfashionable than ever. And I
shall never regret having moved away from there."</p>

<p>So that was Buster Bumblebee's first home&mdash;the old house in the meadow.
It was true that the Bumblebee family numbered at least two hundred
souls. Nobody knew what the exact count might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> been; for in the
daytime all the members of the family were bustling about, never staying
in one place long enough to be counted. And at night they were all too
drowsy to bother their heads over anything but sleep.</p>

<p>It was true, too, that the Bumblebee family filled their house almost to
overflowing&mdash;especially when they began to store away great quantities
of honey in it. But they never seemed to mind being crowded. And if any
of them wanted more room he had only to go out of doors and get it.</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee's mother was the head of the whole family. Everybody
always spoke of her as "the Queen." And she never had to lift her hand,
because there were other members of the family that were both ready and
eager to do everything for her. She was really quite a fine lady.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was generally understood that her son Buster favored his mother.
Certainly he was&mdash;like her&mdash;very handsome, in his suit of black and
yellow velvet. Like his mother, too, he never did a stroke of work. And
although everybody said that Buster Bumblebee was a drone, he never
seemed to mind it in the least.</p>

<h2>II<br />CHIRPY CRICKET'S ADVICE</h2>
</div>

<p>If the summers in Pleasant Valley had been longer perhaps the
honey-makers in Buster Bumblebee's home would have taken a holiday now
and then. But they knew that every day that passed brought cold weather
that much the nearer. So they never once stopped working&mdash;except to
sleep at night. And, like Farmer Green himself, they felt that they must
not waste any of the precious daylight by lying abed late in the
morning. They wanted to be up and in the clover field as soon as it was
light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, with Rusty Wren living right beneath his bedroom window to wake him
at dawn, Farmer Green had no trouble in getting up in good season. But
the Bumblebee family were in no such luck. Even if Rusty Wren had lived
near them in the meadow they could scarcely have heard his dawn song,
because their home was beneath the surface of the ground, in the old
house that had once belonged to Mrs. Field Mouse.</p>

<p>If they could have found an alarm clock somewhere it would have been
easy for them to rise as early in the morning as they wished. But
lacking a clock of that kind&mdash;or any other&mdash;they had to find a different
way of waking themselves.</p>

<p>That was why the workers chose one of their number to be a trumpeter.
And it was her duty to get up bright and early, at three or four
o'clock, and trumpet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> loudly to rouse all the other workers.</p>

<p>How the trumpeter herself managed to awake is something that never
bothered anybody else. It was her business not to oversleep. And she
knew that it would be very unpleasant for her if she failed even once to
do her duty.</p>

<p>Now, it was all well enough for the workers to have the morning silence
broken by the blare of trumpeting. They were eager to get up and begin
their day's work. But Buster Bumblebee did not like that arrangement in
the least. He preferred a good, long night's sleep. And since he never
did any work he thought it was a shame that he should be rudely awakened
in such a fashion.</p>

<p>At home, however, he did not mention his grievance to anyone. But he
talked the matter over with a number of his friends&mdash;outside the family.
And one and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> all agreed that something ought to be done to put a stop to
the trumpeter's noise.</p>

<p>"Why don't you have a pleasant talk with her?" Chirpy Cricket suggested.
"Perhaps she would be willing to trumpet a little more softly if she
knew that she was disturbing you."</p>

<p>That plan did not quite suit Buster Bumblebee.</p>

<p>"It would be hard to have a pleasant talk with the trumpeter," he said.
"She's quite likely to lose her temper. And she might sting me if she
became angry enough."</p>

<p>"Then you must first put her in a good humor," Chirpy Cricket told him
cheerfully. "Begin by saying what a good trumpeter she is and tell her
that her hat is <i>very</i> becoming."</p>

<p>Still Buster Bumblebee was a bit doubtful of the outcome of the scheme.
But at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> last he agreed to give it a trial. "Though I must say I feel
quite nervous," he added. And all Chirpy Cricket's sprightly jokes
failed to make Buster smile.</p>



<hr class="major" />
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;'>
<a name="r6649" id="r6649"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<h2>III<br/>THE RUDE TRUMPETER</h2>
</div>

<p>Yes! At last Buster Bumblebee was worried. Every time he looked at the
trumpeter she seemed in a more peppery temper than ever. Beside her,
some of the other workers appeared positively pleasant. But the
trumpeter wore a frown. And what was still worse, she wore no hat.</p>

<p>How, then, was Buster to follow Chirpy Cricket's advice and tell her
what a becoming hat she was wearing?</p>

<p>"I'll have to think of some other way of making her feel happy&mdash;since
she's bareheaded," said Buster.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, without thinking what he was doing he had spoken his thought right
out loud. And since he was quite near the trumpeter and staring directly
at her, it was no wonder that she heard what he said.</p>

<p>"Don't be impertinent, young man!" the trumpeter snapped, growing
somewhat red in the face. "I'm sure it's no affair of yours whether I
wear a hat or whether I don't. And if you want to make me happy, I'll
tell you the best way in the world."</p>

<p>"Oh! Will you?" cried Buster Bumblebee hopefully. And in his eagerness
he drew even nearer to the trumpeter, who actually smiled at him. But
there was something in her smile that sent a shiver up and down Buster's
back. It was not at all a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"If you want to make me happy all you need do is to keep out of my
sight," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> the trumpeter rudely. "You're just a lazy,
good-for-nothing drone. And for my part, I don't see why you're allowed
to stay in our house. If I had my way you'd be driven out into the world
to shift for yourself.... And I know others who say the same."</p>

<p>Upon hearing that disagreeable speech Buster Bumblebee jumped back
quickly. He was not angry&mdash;but merely disappointed, for he had expected
something quite different.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;er&mdash;you trumpet beautifully," he stammered, remembering that that
was another remark which Chirpy Cricket had suggested as being likely to
put the trumpeter into a pleasant frame of mind.</p>

<p>At that the rude creature laughed most scornfully.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know how you can say <i>that</i>," she sneered. "You're so lazy
and such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> sleepy-head that you never hear me when I wake the
household. In fact, I don't believe you would ever wake up enough to
crawl out of bed if you didn't get hungry&mdash;and goodness knows you do
love to eat."</p>

<p>"No such thing!" cried Buster Bumblebee.</p>

<p>And happening just at that moment to spy an unusually tempting
clover-top close beside him, he lighted upon it and began to suck up its
sweet juices.</p>

<p>The trumpeter at once screamed joyfully and pointed a finger straight at
him.</p>

<p>"There you go!" she cried. "You have to stop and eat even while you're
talking with a lady! Why, you eat and sleep so much that you don't know
what you're doing or saying half the time."</p>

<p>One might naturally think that such a remark would have angered Buster.
But he was not one to lose his temper easily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> And he merely looked at
the trumpeter sadly and said:</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me like that! I'm a queen's son. I'm a gentleman."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<h2>IV<br/>BUSTER FINDS A SISTER</h2>
</div>

<p>Buster Bumblebee's announcement that he was a queen's son&mdash;and a
gentleman&mdash;seemed to amuse the trumpeter hugely. She held her sides and
laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>"That's nothing!" she said at last. "I'm one myself!"</p>

<p>"One what?" Buster asked her quickly. "You're certainly no
gentleman&mdash;for you just referred to yourself as a lady not two minutes
ago. And neither can you be anybody's son, I should think."</p>

<p>"I mean I'm a queen's daughter&mdash;though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> maybe you didn't know it," the
trumpeter replied.</p>

<p>And Buster Bumblebee answered in a dazed fashion that he had had no idea
she was of royal blood, like himself.</p>

<p>"It's true," the trumpeter assured him. "You'd never guess it; but I'm
your own sister."</p>

<p>Well, Buster Bumblebee was so surprised that he almost fell off the
clover-head on which he was sitting. It was really a sad blow to be told
that that disagreeable, vixenish trumpeter, who awakened the workers
each morning, was so closely related to him. But it was no more than he
might have expected, living as he did in a family of more than two
hundred souls.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's hard to believe," he gasped, shaking his head slowly.</p>

<p>"It certainly is," said the trumpeter. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> don't understand how my own
brother can be so lazy as you are."</p>

<p>"It's not that I'm lazy&mdash;it's the way my mother brought me up," Buster
protested.</p>

<p>"<i>Our</i> mother, you mean," the trumpeter corrected him. "Maybe you're
right.... After all, you'd only be in everybody's way if you tried to
work&mdash;you're so awkward and clumsy. So maybe it's just as well for you
to play the gentleman&mdash;though you must find it a dull life."</p>

<p>"It suits me," said Buster. "But I do wish you could manage to rouse the
workers in the morning without disturbing me." He was bolder, now that
he knew he was talking to his own sister.</p>

<p>The trumpeter pondered for a little time before replying.</p>

<p>"It's my duty to trumpet loudly," she said at last. "The summer is none
too long. And there's a great deal of honey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> to be made before fall....
Have you thought of stuffing your ears with cotton?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, no!" said Buster Bumblebee. "That's a fine plan, I'm sure. And
I'll follow it this very night."</p>

<p>So he thanked his new-found sister and said good-by, for he wanted to
look for some cotton at once.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" the trumpeter exclaimed as soon as Buster had left her.
"Here I've wasted a precious quarter of an hour when I should have been
working." Thereupon she began gathering nectar as fast as she could, and
forgot all about Buster Bumblebee and his trouble.</p>

<p>When he left the trumpeter in the clover field, Buster was feeling quite
cheerful. Although Chirpy Cricket's advice had been of little use to
him, Buster's talk with the trumpeter had ended pleasantly enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> And
now he expected that he would be able to sleep as late as he
pleased&mdash;with the help of a bit of cotton.</p>

<p>Buster flew fast, as he left the fragrant clover behind him, to hunt for
the cotton that he needed. But he soon paused in his rapid flight and
sat down on a sprig of honeysuckle, to think.</p>

<p>He was puzzled. He hadn't the slightest idea where he could find any
cotton. So what was the use of hurrying, if he didn't know where he was
going?</p>

<h2>V<br/>MR. CROW TO THE RESCUE</h2>
</div>

<p>As Buster sat on the sprig of wild honeysuckle, wondering where to look
for a bit of cotton with which to stuff his ears, a bird fluttered down
and perched upon the old stone wall to which the honeysuckle clung. The
name of the newcomer was Jasper Jay. And Buster Bumblebee was glad to
see him, because he wanted help from somebody and he didn't care who it
was.</p>

<p>"Where could a person get a small piece of cotton?" he asked Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>And Jasper&mdash;who would gladly have made a lunch of Buster, had he not
been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> afraid of getting stung&mdash;Jasper promptly replied with another
question:</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do with cotton?" He was a very curious fellow,
this Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee had no objection to explaining everything to him. And
then&mdash;and only then&mdash;was Jasper willing to tell what he knew.</p>

<p>"Cotton&mdash;" said he&mdash;"cotton grows in fields. I know that much. And
what's more, I know it doesn't grow in Pleasant Valley, for I live here
the whole year round and I've never seen any."</p>

<p>That was bad news for Buster.</p>

<p>"What do you advise me to do?" he inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"Ask my cousin, Mr. Crow," said Jasper Jay instantly. "He's a great
traveller. Spends his winters in the South, <i>he</i> does. And no doubt he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>can
help you."</p>

<span class='caption'>Buster Thanks Old Mr. Crow For His Advice. (<i>Page 25</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>"Where can I find Mr. Crow?" Buster Bumblebee asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know of any better place to look than the cornfield," Jasper
Jay told him.</p>

<p>Luckily Buster knew where the cornfield was. So he started off at once
to find Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>And sure enough! as soon as Buster reached the edge of the cornfield,
there was the old gentleman, sitting on the topmost rail of the fence
and looking as if he had just enjoyed an excellent meal.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw that Buster Bumblebee wanted to talk with him, old Mr.
Crow was willing enough to listen, for he always liked to know about
other people's affairs. He kept nodding his head with a wise air while
Buster explained to him how he wished to find some cotton, with which to
stuff his ears every night, so that he might not be disturbed when the
trumpeter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> aroused the household at three or four o'clock each morning.</p>

<p>"That's a splendid plan," said old Mr. Crow when Buster had finished.
"An excellent plan&mdash;but you may as well forget it, because there's no
cotton growing in these parts. Cotton grows in the South, more than a
thousand miles away. Next winter when I go to the South I might be able
to find some for you, and bring it back with me in the spring. But that
wouldn't help you now."</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee was quite discouraged. And since he didn't know what to
do, he asked Mr. Crow what he would suggest.</p>

<p>"Why don't you set back the hands of the family clock?" the old
gentleman asked. "If you make the clock three or four hours slow the
trumpeter won't trumpet until six or seven or eight o'clock. And I'm
sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> that's late enough for anybody to get up."</p>

<p>Buster shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>"We haven't any clock at our house," he explained.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;&mdash;" said old Mr. Crow, "then, if you want more sleep why don't
you go to bed earlier? If you went to bed three or four hours before
sunset you wouldn't mind getting up at dawn."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" Buster shouted. "That's just what I'll do! And I'm certainly
much obliged to you, Mr. Crow, for helping me."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," said the old gentleman, looking greatly pleased with
himself.</p>

<p>"I won't tell anybody," Buster promised.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean that, exactly," Mr. Crow told him hastily. "If you
want to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> inform your friends how clever I am, I have no objection, of
course."</p>

<p>Then Buster went off, thinking what a kind person old Mr. Crow was. And
that very afternoon, long before sunset, he curled himself up in an
out-of-the-way corner of the house and went to sleep. Everybody was so
busy hurrying in and out in order to finish the day's work that no one
noticed or disturbed him. And when the trumpeter sounded the rising call
the next morning Buster Bumblebee was actually the first one in the
house to open his eyes and jump up and hasten out to get his breakfast.</p>

<p>All of which only went to prove that old Mr. Crow knew a thing or
two&mdash;and maybe even more.</p>

<h2>VI<br/>JOHNNIE GREEN IS STUNG</h2>
</div>

<p>There had been so much rain early in the summer that even by the middle
of August Farmer Green had not been able to finish his haying. His son
Johnnie was sorry, too&mdash;because he had to work in the hot hayfield
almost every day, when he would far rather have gone swimming in the
mill-pond, under the shade of the great willow.</p>

<p>Sometimes Johnnie rode on the hayrake. And since he liked to drive the
old horse Ebenezer, he didn't object to that part of his duties so much.
What he hated most was pitching hay with a pitchfork. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> next to that,
he disliked going to the spring for a jugful of water.</p>

<p>But those unpleasant tasks were nothing at all compared with what
happened to him one day when he stepped squarely upon the doorway of the
Bumblebee family's house.</p>

<p>Johnnie's carelessness made the workers angry at once. And several of
them rushed out and stung Johnnie Green severely.</p>

<p>Then <i>he</i> was angry. And he declared he would "fix them"&mdash;as soon as he
could think of a good way to do it.</p>

<p>And that very afternoon, while he was bringing the heavy jug from the
spring, Johnnie Green thought of a fine plan for punishing the Bumblebee
family. He liked his plan so well that he could hardly wait to try it;
and he went back to the hayfield almost at a run, whereas he usually
sauntered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> along so slowly that his father often had to speak to him
somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>But this time Farmer Green could not complain. Johnnie even brought the
jug&mdash;and the tin cup too&mdash;to the knoll in the meadow where his father
and the hired man were working. And then Farmer Green said:</p>

<p>"How are your stings now?"</p>

<p>"Awful!" Johnnie informed him hopefully.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd like to stop work for the rest of the day and go swimming,"
said Farmer Green, with a wink at the hired man, "unless you're feeling
too miserable," he added.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Oh, no!" cried Johnnie. "My stings aren't too bad for that!"
And he started off at once across the field, taking the jug with him.</p>

<p>"I'll leave the jug among the brakes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> the fence-corner," he called,
as he trotted away.</p>

<p>Now, Johnnie Green took the jug with him because he needed it. It was
part of his plan for punishing the Bumblebee family. And instead of
going straight to the fence-corner, Johnnie made at once for the
Bumblebee family's front door. As soon as he reached it he poured some
of the water out of the jug&mdash;but not all of it. Then he put his ear to
the jug's mouth and listened. And he smiled happily&mdash;in spite of his
stings&mdash;as he heard the roar from inside it.</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee, hurrying home to go to bed&mdash;for he was still following
Mr. Crow's plan&mdash;Buster noticed Johnnie and wondered what he was doing.
But as soon as he went inside the house he forgot all about Johnnie
Green. And when, a few moments later, there was a terrible sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> of
scraping and scratching in the long hall that led to the innermost part
of the house, Buster Bumblebee never once thought to mention to anyone
that he had seen Johnnie in the dooryard.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<h2>VII<br/>A JUGFUL OF BUMBLEBEES</h2>
</div>

<p>When the workers&mdash;as well as Buster Bumblebee&mdash;heard the raking,
scraping sound in the hall of their house they all stopped what they
were doing and shrilled "An enemy!" And with one accord they rushed for
the front door. They were terribly angry.</p>

<p>Not wishing to miss anything that was going to happen, Buster joined the
mob and went sailing out into the open meadow. And there, quite close to
the door, stood the queer object that Buster had noticed together with
Johnnie Green only a minute before. He wondered now what that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> strange
thing was; for Buster Bumblebee did not know a jug when he saw one. And
neither did the workers, nor any other member of the Bumblebee family.</p>

<p>"That's the enemy!" cried Buster suddenly, pointing to the jug. "It was
talking out of its mouth right into Johnnie Green's ear when I came
home."</p>

<p>Sounding a dreadful battle cry, all the workers turned upon the jug and
buzzed so near it that they couldn't help hearing the same roaring from
inside it to which Johnnie Green had listened with so much pleasure.</p>

<p>"Buster's almost right!" several of the workers shouted. "The enemy has
hidden inside this thing. And we'll have to go in and sting him."</p>

<p>At that the workers began to pop into the jug, which Johnnie Green had
thoughtfully left uncorked. And Buster Bumblebee,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> still eager to see
everything, hastened to plunge inside the dim jug along with the rest.</p>

<p>It was soon not a dim but a dark jug. For the moment the last angry
Bumblebee had disappeared inside it Johnnie Green stole quickly up from
behind a haycock and slipped the cork into the mouth of the jug.</p>

<p>Johnnie's face wore a grin of joy. Perhaps he did not stop to realize
that he was breaking up a happy home.</p>

<p>"I've got 'em!" he shouted aloud. And then he shook the jug vigorously,
listening with delight to the sound of the splashing water within. Soon
he set the jug behind the sheltering haycock and sat down beside it to
make further plans. It was Johnnie's intention then to drown everything
on the farm that carried a sting&mdash;wasps, hornets, honey bees. He was
not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> quite sure about mosquitoes, for he thought they might be hard to
capture in great numbers.</p>

<p>Since he was intending to go swimming, he did not care to waste much
more of the afternoon by staying in the meadow. So he proceeded to empty
the jug.</p>

<p>It certainly <i>looked</i> as if the Bumblebee family had met with ill
fortune. Several dozen workers&mdash;and Buster, too&mdash;lay limp and
water-soaked upon the ground, when Johnnie Green hurried away to the
spring to get more water for his father and the hired man, before he
went to the mill-pond.</p>

<p>But it was not long before the half-drowned Buster and his companions
began to stir slightly. Gradually the sun dried their wings and warmed
their chilled bodies. And one by one they picked themselves up and
scurried into their house.</p>

<p>They never knew exactly what had happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> But the workers agreed upon
one point. They decided that somehow the whole trouble had been Buster's
fault&mdash;though they couldn't explain in just what way.</p>

<p>Anyhow, after that the workers looked on Buster with more disfavor than
ever. They were forever remarking how lazy and stupid he was. And even
the trumpeter was heard to declare that she was ashamed of him&mdash;though
he <i>was</i> her own brother.</p>

<h2>VIII<br/>BUSTER THE BOASTER</h2>
</div>

<p>As far back as Buster Bumblebee could remember, he had heard about the
Robber Fly. Even the fiercest fighters among the workers spoke his name
with great awe. And from everything Buster could learn, his family had
good reason to fear that dreadful enemy.</p>

<p>When Buster first left the house to make excursions to the flower garden
and the clover field he had felt quite uneasy. He half-expected that the
Robber Fly would pop out from behind a blossom at any moment and pounce
upon him. For the Robber Fly was a bold, bad villain. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> those that
were so unfortunate as to find themselves caught by him and held fast in
his long, spiny feet had only a very slight chance of getting away from
him.</p>

<p>No one of the Bumblebee family knew where the Robber Fly lived. But it
was said that he often lurked on the ground, watching for victims. And
when he spied one he would fly quickly up with a loud buzz and dart upon
the unfortunate.</p>

<p>He had big, keen eyes which enabled him to see very clearly. And he had
long, narrow wings which bore him through the air with great swiftness.
And he had&mdash;worst of all&mdash;a sharp, piercing beak which was most
frightful to gaze upon.</p>

<p>Now, in spite of his name the Robber Fly looked like no fly that was
ever seen in Pleasant Valley. Strange as it may seem, in spite of his
cruel beak, his long wings, and his spiny feet, he looked not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> little
as if he might have been a near relation of Buster Bumblebee. Of course,
any member of the Bumblebee family would have known at a glance that he
was not one of them. But probably Johnnie Green&mdash;if he had noticed
him&mdash;would have thought the Robber Fly some sort of bumblebee.</p>

<p>Since this monster was known to appear now and then in the neighborhood,
one can easily understand why Buster Bumblebee was a bit timid when he
first began to venture abroad alone. But as time passed, his dread of
meeting the Robber Fly gradually faded. Not only had nobody seen the
Robber for a long while, but some began to say that they thought he must
have met with an accident, or perhaps he had moved to other parts, and
they didn't believe he would ever be heard of again. And Buster himself
began to boast that he wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> afraid of the Robber Fly and said that he
was sorry that the Robber had gone away before he had had a chance to
see him.</p>

<p>Buster's mother, the Queen, happened to hear her son make that remark
one day. And she promptly told him that he was a stupid, silly boaster.</p>

<p>"If you knew what happened to your poor father last fall you would never
want even to hear the Robber Fly's name mentioned again," the Queen
declared, as a shiver&mdash;or a shudder&mdash;or both&mdash;passed up and down her
royal back.</p>

<p>But Buster Bumblebee, being very young and somewhat stupid as well, said
"Oh, nonsense!" under his breath, so low that his mother, the Queen,
could not hear him.</p>


<hr class="major" />

<a name="r1972" id="r1972"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<h2>IX<br/>THE ROBBER FLY AT LAST</h2>
</div>

<p>Though Buster's mother, the Queen, did not hear him when he said "Oh,
nonsense!" under his breath, there were others standing near him that
caught the words. And they were quite indignant that anybody should
scoff at the Queen like that.</p>

<p>They were workers&mdash;those that overheard Buster Bumblebee's remark when
his mother as much as told him that he had better beware of the wicked
Robber Fly. They were workers; and they did not approve of the lazy
Buster.</p>

<p>"Let's teach that young loafer a lesson!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> they said to one another
(there were three of them). And straightway they began to scheme and
plan how they should give Buster Bumblebee a thorough fright, in the
hope of making him more respectful to his mother, the Queen.</p>

<p>At least, that is what the workers said. But, as a matter of fact, each
of them had reasons of her own for wanting to scare Buster. Indeed,
there wasn't a worker in the house that was not disgusted with his
laziness. And if he hadn't been the son of the Queen they would
certainly have driven him out into the wide world long before.</p>

<p>Of course, Buster had no idea of what was afoot. He continued to tell
everybody how sorry he was that he had never met the Robber Fly, until a
few began to believe that he must be very brave indeed. But they were
those that didn't know him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> well. As for the workers, there wasn't one
in the Bumblebee household that was deceived by Buster's bold talk. They
all knew him for the coward he was.</p>

<p>Well, the very next day after Buster's impertinence to his mother a
worker called Peevish Peggy stopped and spoke to him as he sat on a
clover-head.</p>

<p>"If I were you I wouldn't come near the clover patch," she said. "You
know the Robber Fly often prowls about on the ground. And it would be
easy for him to catch you on a clover-top, you're so fat and clumsy....
Why don't you dine on the hollyhocks in the flower garden? They are
high, and much safer."</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee seemed greatly amused.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" he laughed&mdash;as well as "Ha, ha!" And then he said: "It seems
to me that you are the one that ought to buzz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> around the hollyhocks,
since you are so nervous about the Robber Fly."</p>

<p>The worker, Peevish Peggy, at once flew into a temper.</p>

<p>"You'd better look out!" she warned Buster. "Once the Robber Fly pounces
on you you'll be so frightened you can't even squirm."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" said Buster.</p>

<p>The quick-tempered worker, Peevish Peggy, looked slyly over her shoulder
and nodded slightly.</p>

<p>Buster did not see the form that crept nearer and nearer to him, a
little later. And he was still chuckling to himself when he heard a
terrible humming. Then all at once he felt himself seized and held in a
grip like iron.</p>

<p>He was sure that the Robber Fly had him at last. And he was too
frightened for anything.</p>

<h2>X<br/>BUSTER MAKES A SPEECH</h2>
</div>

<p>At first, when he found himself in the grip of what he was sure must be
the Robber Fly, Buster Bumblebee was so alarmed that he could not even
scream. But in a moment or two he found his voice. And he shrieked
"Help! Help!" in a most frantic tone, hoping that some one would come
and save him.</p>

<p>But nobody came. And Buster expected every instant to feel the cruel
beak of the Robber Fly, when there was a sudden commotion behind his
back. Somebody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> else cried out now. And Buster knew the voice, too. Yes!
Buster was sure that Peevish Peggy had come to help him. But there was
one thing that puzzled him. Peevish Peggy seemed to be fully as
frightened as Buster himself. At least, her cries sounded as if she were
in great terror.</p>

<p>Probably she's afraid the Robber Fly has hurt me, Buster thought. And he
reflected that in spite of her sharp tongue Peevish Peggy was more
kind-hearted than he had ever dreamed.</p>

<p>The next instant Buster felt himself suddenly released. At the same time
something swept him off the clover-top; and he barely managed to save
himself from a bad fall.</p>

<p>Somewhere he could hear a loud buzz, as of several angry voices. But he
did not care to show himself enough to find out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
what was happening. For the time being he was content to stay snugly
hidden among the thick clover leaves.</p>

<span class='caption'>Buster Shouted For Everybody to Keep Quiet. (<i>Page 48</i>)</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>After a while the uproar ceased. But even then Buster Bumblebee was in
no hurry to leave his shelter.</p>

<p>When he did at last reach home he found the whole family much upset.
Everybody was talking at once. And in a household of more than two
hundred that meant that the noise was almost deafening.</p>

<p>Naturally, Buster Bumblebee wanted to know what was the matter. It was a
long time, however, before anyone would&mdash;or could&mdash;listen to him. But at
last he succeeded in getting the ear of the trumpeter.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard the news?" she asked. "The Robber Fly came to the
clover patch to-day. And Peevish Peggy had a very narrow escape. If it
hadn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> been for several other workers who happened to be gathering
clover nectar nearby, there's no telling where she would be now."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" Buster inquired.</p>

<p>"Resting in bed," the trumpeter explained. (Even Buster wondered how she
could rest with all that racket in the house!) "She's had a bad fright,
poor thing!" the trumpeter added.</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee suddenly grew much excited. And he climbed up on a
table and shouted for everybody to be quiet.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you know about me!" he cried, as soon as the house was
still. "The Robber Fly attacked me. But <i>I</i> don't need to go to bed. I'm
not the least bit nervous."</p>

<p>Several of the family near him began <b>to</b> titter.</p>

<p>And the Queen herself stepped forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> and commanded Buster to hop down
from the table at once.</p>

<p>He obeyed promptly. But he was quite puzzled. No one seemed to believe
what he said. And it was a long time before he learned what had actually
happened. At last a spiteful worker informed him that he had never been
in the clutches of the Robber Fly at all. Peevish Peggy and some of her
companions had played a trick on Buster&mdash;because of his boasting. She
had seized him when he wasn't looking. And he had screamed so loud that
the Robber Fly&mdash;who happened to be near&mdash;had heard him.</p>

<p>Then the Robber Fly had rushed up and seized Peevish Peggy, who had
promptly let go of Buster Bumblebee.</p>

<p>The worker who told these things to Buster Bumblebee actually laughed in
his face. And Buster was so surprised&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> so crestfallen&mdash;that he
couldn't say a word for a long time.</p>

<p>And never again did Buster mention the Robber Fly's name.</p>

<h2>XI<br/>THE DRONE</h2>
</div>

<p>Yes! Buster Bumblebee was a drone. He never gathered any nectar from the
flowers and brought it home to help swell the family store of honey. He
let the workers of the household do that. And since they never
complained, but seemed to enjoy their drudgery, Buster saw no reason why
he should interfere with the honey-making in any way.</p>

<p>He was content to live a life of ease and pleasure. And never having to
bestir himself&mdash;never having to hurry or worry&mdash;he quickly grew into a
somewhat clumsy and blundering young gentleman. And what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> was still
worse, this handsome young idler soon gained the name of being none too
keen-witted. <i>Good-natured, but a bit stupid</i>&mdash;that was what the field
and forest folk called Buster Bumblebee.</p>

<p>But bless you! <i>He</i> never bothered his head with what people said. When
anybody called him a drone he would only laugh. And when some busybody
asked him for pity's sake why didn't he go to work, he would merely grin
and reply that he was a queen's son and that queens' sons never did
anything except eat a plenty and have a good time.</p>

<p>Well, that must have been an excellent answer, for it seemed to keep
people quiet. And it made some think that perhaps Buster Bumblebee was
not quite so dull as he often appeared.</p>

<p>Once, indeed, he had thought it would be fun to help with the
honey-making. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> he stopped one of the workers when she was on her way
home with a load of nectar.</p>

<p>"Let me help you carry that home!" Buster said.</p>

<p>Now, the workers were all a shrewish lot. They were terribly
short-tempered&mdash;especially if anybody interfered with their work, which
they loved better than anything else in the world.</p>

<p>"Don't you come near me!" snapped the worker angrily. "Keep away or I'll
sting you!" she threatened.</p>

<p>Naturally, a happy, easy-going person like Buster Bumblebee wasn't
looking for trouble of that sort. So he dodged clumsily out of sight
behind a milkweed; and he made up his mind then that that was the last
time he would ever have anything to do with one of those testy
honey-makers.</p>

<p>Of course it was a bit difficult to avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> them entirely in a family of
two hundred or more, all living together in a medium-sized house. And so
Buster Bumblebee decided at last that he would be far happier in some
place that was not so crowded, and where there was no work going on&mdash;and
no workers.</p>

<p>And so, one fine August day, Buster left the family home, never to set
foot inside it again. But he often passed that way and lingered just
outside the door, to listen to the music and the sound of dancing
within.</p>

<p>That was the thing that he missed most; for, like all his family, he was
fond of music. And he was forever humming to himself as he sipped nectar
 from
the clover-tops or the flowers in Farmer Green's garden.</p>

<h2>XII<br/>THE CARPENTER BEE</h2>
</div>

<p>After Buster Bumblebee left the old house in the meadow, where Mrs.
Field Mouse had once lived, he had no real home. Like that quarrelsome
rascal, Peter Mink, he would crawl into any good place that he happened
to find. Sometimes Buster chose a hole in a fence-rail, and sometimes a
crack in the side of one of the farm-buildings. He really didn't much
care where he spent the night, provided it was not too far from the
flower garden or the clover field.</p>

<p>Not being one of the worrying kind, Buster was quite contented with his
lot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> And it would never have occurred to him to live in any different
style had it not been for a remark that little Mrs. Ladybug made to him
one day.</p>

<p>"I should think&mdash;" she said&mdash;"I should think that the son of a queen
ought to have a house of his own, instead of sleeping&mdash;like a
tramp&mdash;where night overtakes him."</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Ladybug's words did not offend Buster Bumblebee in the least.</p>

<p>"No doubt you know best," he told her. "But how can I build a house?
I've never worked in all my life. And I don't intend to begin now."</p>

<p>"Why not get some one to build a house for you?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"I never thought of that!" he cried. "Whom would you suggest?"</p>

<p>"I know the very person!" Mrs. Ladybug told him. "He's a Carpenter Bee;
and he lives in the big poplar by the brook.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> Perhaps you know him.
Johnnie Green calls him Whiteface," she said. "They do say he's a very
skillful workman."</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee replied that he had never met the Carpenter, but that
he would go and see him at once. So over to the big poplar he flew. And
soon he was knocking boldly at the door of the Carpenter's house.</p>

<p>Pretty soon a mild-appearing person, who looked not a little like Buster
himself, stepped through the doorway. He wore a white patch across his
front and his clothes needed brushing sadly, for they showed many marks
of sawdust.</p>

<p>"Are you the Carpenter?" Buster Bumblebee inquired.</p>

<p>The mild stranger said he was.</p>

<p>"How would you like to build a house for me?" Buster
asked him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The Carpenter seemed greatly surprised at the suggestion.
"I don't think I'd like it very well," he said timidly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Buster demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm busy building an addition to my house," the Carpenter
explained. "And besides, you're a total stranger. I've never seen you
before; and we might quarrel if I did any work for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Buster Bumblebee assured him. "You couldn't quarrel with me,
because I'm the most peace-loving person in Pleasant Valley."</p>

<p>"There!" the Carpenter cried. "I knew as soon as I set eyes on you that
we were bound not to agree.... I've always claimed that there's no
peacefuller person than I am in this whole neighborhood. So here we are,
quarreling already!"</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right," Buster said then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> "I'll agree that you like peace
more than I do. But remember! Next to you there's no one that hates a
fight the way I do&mdash;and hates work, too!"</p>

<h2>XIII<br/>THE CARPENTER'S PROMISE</h2>
</div>

<p>When Buster Bumblebee told Whiteface the Carpenter Bee, that he hated to
work that honest artisan stared at his caller in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You're a queer one!" he said at last "But there's something about you
that I can't help liking, though it would be hard for me to say just
what it is&mdash;so please don't ask me!"</p>

<p>"Then you'll make me a house, after all?" Buster cried joyfully.</p>

<p>"I will," the Carpenter promised, "just as soon as I finish the addition
I'm building to my own home."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Buster. And wishing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> Carpenter Bee a hasty
good-afternoon, he flew off to find little Mrs. Ladybug and tell her
that he was going to have a house of his own, just as she had suggested.</p>

<p>After that the news spread quickly, for Mrs. Ladybug was somewhat of a
gossip&mdash;in a pleasant enough way. Being much interested in her
neighbors, she liked to talk about their affairs. And now she told
everyone that Buster Bumblebee was going to have a fine new house, and
that the Carpenter was going to build it for him.</p>

<p>Naturally, Buster's friends all told him that they were glad to hear of
his good fortune. And whenever anyone mentioned the matter, Buster
promptly invited him to come to a party that he intended to give as soon
as his new home was ready to move into.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ladybug tells me that I ought to have a house-warming," Buster
explained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> And though some of his neighbors didn't know what he meant
by that, they said "Of course!" and tried to look wise.</p>

<p>There was only one thing about the whole affair that annoyed Buster:
when people asked him when his new house would be finished he was unable
to tell them.</p>

<p>"Well, when is the Carpenter going to start building it?" they would
ask. And he could only reply that as soon as the Carpenter completed the
addition to his own house he had promised to begin to build Buster's.</p>

<p>Now, many people were satisfied with that answer. But there were some
(they were the curious ones) that insisted on knowing exactly when that
would be. And then there was nothing that Buster Bumblebee could do
except to admit that he didn't know.</p>

<p>"Why don't you find out about it?" asked the most curious person in all
Pleasant Valley&mdash;and that, of course, was old Mr. Crow. "If I were you
I'd go to the Carpenter and <i>insist</i> on his telling me."</p>

<p>So Buster Bumblebee began calling at the Carpenter's house every day.
Some days he even went there two or three times. It must have been
annoying for anybody as busy as the Carpenter to be interrupted so
often&mdash;and always for the same reason. But he never once thought of
being angry&mdash;though he did wish that Buster would let him work in peace.</p>

<p>His answer to Buster's question was always the same: "I'm afraid my
house won't be finished to-morrow."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<h2>XIV<br/>BAD NEWS</h2>
</div>

<p>It is not surprising that the Carpenter's answer failed to satisfy
Buster Bumblebee.</p>

<p>"I really must know when my house will be ready!" he cried at last.
"I've invited all my friends to a house-warming. And how can I have one
unless I have a house to warm?"</p>

<p>The Carpenter slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me!" he said wearily. "I've enough to trouble me right here
at home without answering any riddles for strangers."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll get your house finished sometime," Buster ventured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope to," said the Carpenter, "though it certainly won't be
to-morrow, on account of all the interruptions I'm having to-day."</p>

<p>Now, that honest workman meant his remark to be a hint. But the idea
never occurred to Buster that the Carpenter had <i>him</i> in mind, when he
mentioned interruptions. And Buster went right on talking.</p>

<p>"I'd suggest that you work nights as well as in the daytime," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," the Carpenter promised. "And now," he added, "now
I must go back to my carpentering&mdash;if you'll excuse me."</p>

<p>And before Buster could say another word the Carpenter slipped through
his doorway and vanished.</p>

<p>"I hope he'll do as I suggested," Buster Bumblebee said to himself, as
he moved aimlessly away from the big poplar where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> the Carpenter lived.
"If I shouldn't get my house until cold weather comes I don't see how I
could have a house-warming; and then all my friends would be
disappointed."</p>

<p>The more he thought about the matter the more disturbed he became, until
at last (on the following day) he felt that he simply <i>must</i> go back and
speak to the Carpenter again.</p>

<p>Buster noticed, as he drew near to the Carpenter's house once more, that
there was a crowd in the Carpenter's dooryard. Everybody looked so
sorrowful that Buster was sure something dreadful had happened.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked little Mrs. Ladybug, who was wiping her
eyes with a lace pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>"It's the Carpenter," she answered, as soon as she could speak. "He's
disappeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> And now we've just heard what's become of him. Johnnie
Green caught him yesterday and has made him a prisoner!"</p>

<p>That was bad news indeed&mdash;for Buster Bumblebee. He was so sorry that he
swallowed hard three or four times before he could say a word. And then
he began to groan.</p>

<p>"This is terrible!" he moaned at last. And all the Carpenter's neighbors
gathered around him and said what a kind-hearted young gentleman he was,
but that it was no more than you might expect of a queen's son.</p>

<p>"The Carpenter must have been a dear friend of yours," quavered old
Daddy Longlegs, tottering up to Buster and peering into his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Buster Bumblebee. "But he promised to build a house for
me as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> soon as he had finished working on his own. So his being a
prisoner is pretty hard on me. For I've invited all my friends to a
house-warming and I don't know what to do."</p>

<h2>XV<br/>THE PRISONER</h2>
</div>

<p>Buster Bumblebee did not stay long in the dooryard of the missing
Carpenter. Saying a mournful good-by to the sad company, he flew away
toward Farmer Green's house. It was there that the Carpenter was a
prisoner. And Buster could only hope that he might find some way of
setting the woodworker free.</p>

<p>Luckily Buster Bumblebee did not have to look long for what he was
seeking. On the porch of the farmhouse he soon discovered a honey box,
with glass sides. And whom should he see inside it, sitting on a little
heap of wild rose leaves and looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> forlorn and unhappy&mdash;whom should
Buster see but the Carpenter.</p>

<p>Buster crowded close against the glass and began to call so loud that
the Carpenter couldn't help hearing him. And then the poor fellow came
and stood on the other side of the glass barrier, as near Buster as he
could get.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come out?" Buster asked.</p>

<p>"How can I?" said the Carpenter. "Don't you see that I'm a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Yes! But why don't you cut your way out?" Buster Bumblebee asked him.</p>

<p>"Well, I've tried," the Carpenter confessed. "But this glass is so hard
that I can't even dent it."</p>

<p>"But you're a woodworker&mdash;not a glass-worker!" exclaimed Buster
Bumblebee. "And if you're as skillful as people say you are, you ought
to be able to bore a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> hole through one of the wooden ends of your
prison."</p>

<p>At that suggestion the Carpenter looked decidedly happier.</p>

<p>"That's so!" he exclaimed. "I wish I had thought of that before."</p>

<p>Of course it was Buster that thought of the plan, then; but he didn't
say so to the Carpenter. Instead, Buster shouted through the glass:</p>

<p>"Get to work at once! And I'll wait for you."</p>

<p>So the Carpenter began to cut away at an end of the honey box. But
unluckily for him, he had hardly begun his task when Johnnie Green came
dancing out upon the porch, followed by two strange boys.</p>

<p>"Here he is!" cried Johnnie, kneeling beside the Carpenter's prison.
"See him! Do you know what he is?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The two strange boys did not wear overalls, like Johnnie Green. But they
did not seem to mind that. They knelt right down beside him in their
spick-and-span velvet suits and stared curiously at the Carpenter.</p>

<p>"He's a bumblebee!" one of them exclaimed. And the other echoed
immediately, "He's a bumblebee!" Being twins, and looking just alike,
they always tried to do and say the same things.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green did not tell them their mistake. With an odd smile he slid
aside one of the glass doors of the Carpenter's prison and picked the
frightened captive up with his fingers.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the two guests. "Won't he sting you?"</p>

<p>"Naw!" said Johnnie Green scornfully. "He won't sting me. He knows me."</p>

<p>For a few minutes the two city boys&mdash;for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> that is what they were&mdash;for a
few minutes they watched Johnnie Green expectantly. They seemed to be
waiting for something. And they were. They were waiting for Johnnie
Green to be stung.</p>

<p>But nothing of the sort happened. And soon one of them said:</p>

<p>"I wish I had a pet bumblebee."</p>

<p>"So do I!" said the other twin.</p>

<p>"Do you?" asked Johnnie Green. "Well,&mdash;I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll
give you each a honey box. And maybe you can catch some bumblebees, if
you want to."</p>

<p>Of course, the twins were delighted. And Johnnie Green appeared pleased
too. Perhaps he should have told his little friends that his pet was not
a bumblebee at all&mdash;but a carpenter bee&mdash;and that carpenter bees never
sting people.</p>

<p>But Johnnie Green did not always do just exactly as he ought to have
done.</p>

<h2>XVI<br/>THE TWINS IN THE CLOVER PATCH</h2>
</div>

<p>The twins&mdash;Johnnie Green's guests&mdash;each with a honey box in his hand,
began at once to hunt for bumblebees. And if Buster Bumblebee had been
wiser he would have flown away at once.</p>

<p>But he had no idea that he would have any trouble dodging a
boy&mdash;especially a city boy. So he lingered on the porch to see what
happened. As soon as Johnnie Green should put the Carpenter back in his
prison Buster intended to urge him once more to cut his way through the
wood&mdash;and to freedom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon Buster had his chance. Again he crowded close to the glass door of
the Carpenter's cage. And then Johnnie Green's sharp eyes spied him.</p>

<p>"There's one!" said Johnnie Green to one of the twins. And at that the
eager youngster pounced quickly on Buster, picked him up gingerly, and
popped him quickly into a prison exactly like the one that held the
Carpenter.</p>

<p>"He didn't sting me!" cried Buster's captor proudly, while Johnnie Green
stared at him in astonishment and&mdash;it must be confessed&mdash;with some
disappointment, too.</p>

<p>Now, Johnnie knew a good many things about the field and forest folk in
Pleasant Valley. He knew that the Carpenter (or Whiteface, as Johnnie
called him) couldn't sting anybody. But he had always supposed that all
bumblebees stung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> fiercely. And that was where he was mistaken. It was
true that Buster's mother, the Queen, could sting when she wanted to.
And all those hot-tempered workers who lived with her had stings just as
hot as their tempers. But Buster and his brothers (for he had brothers)
were not armed with such weapons.</p>

<p>Naturally, the other twin was now more eager than ever to capture a
bumblebee of his own. And since Johnnie did not want to disappoint a
guest he soon suggested that they go over to the clover patch.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of bumblebees over there, always," said Johnnie Green
hopefully.</p>

<p>So Buster had a free ride to the clover field; for his twin insisted on
taking his new pet right along with him.</p>

<p>"Besides, I may want to catch some more like him," he explained.</p>

<p>Looking out through the glass sides of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> his prison, which his captor
held tightly in one hand, Buster Bumblebee saw many of his mother's
workers hovering about the clover-tops, gathering nectar for the
honeycomb at home.</p>

<p>The twins saw the workers, too. They were delighted. And so was Johnnie
Green.</p>

<p>"Take all the bumblebees you want!" said Johnnie. "My father won't
care."</p>

<p>Both twins grabbed at the same time. They both shrieked at the same
time, too&mdash;for each of them felt a sharp pain, as if a red-hot needle
had been run into his finger. And Buster Bumblebee felt himself falling.
Then followed a crash of splintering glass. And in another moment Buster
was hurrying away across the clover field.</p>

<p>When he was stung by the worker he had seized, Buster's twin had dropped
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> honey box. And it had fallen squarely upon a rock and broken.</p>

<p>If Buster had not been in such haste to escape he would have heard still
another shout. For the news spread like wildfire among the workers&mdash;the
news that an army of boys had attacked them. And a terrible-tempered
relation of Buster's known as Peppery Polly darted at Johnnie Green and
buried her sting deep in the back of that young gentleman's sun-browned
neck.</p>

<p>As for the Carpenter, everybody quite forgot about him. Johnnie and the
twins were too busy putting mud poultices on their wounds, to ease their
aches and pains, to think of the prisoner they had left on the farmhouse
porch. It was not until the next day that Johnnie Green remembered his
new pet. And when he went to see him then the honey box was empty. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Carpenter had cut a tunnel through the wall of his prison.</p>

<p>Later the Carpenter sent a message to Buster, by little Mrs. Ladybug.</p>

<p>"The Carpenter has lost so much time," she told Buster, "that he thinks
he will never be able to finish the addition to his house. So he says
you'll have to get somebody else to build your new home for you."</p>

<p>At first Buster was disappointed. But he soon recovered his good
spirits.</p>

<p>"After all, it's just as well," he remarked cheerfully. "I know where
there's a fine new house right in the clover patch. And I'll move into
it at once."</p>

<p>Of course he meant the honey box which the boy had dropped upon the rock
and forgotten. So Buster had his new home without the help of the
Carpenter. And all his friends agreed that the house-warming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> he gave
was the most successful that ever was known in those parts. It took
place on the hottest day of the summer. And Buster's house was so warm
that three of his guests almost had sunstrokes&mdash;and had to be helped
home.</p>

<h2>XVII<br/>BUSTER LEARNS OF THE RAISING BEE</h2>
</div>

<p>"Yes!" said Jimmy Rabbit. "I hear that there's going to be a raising bee
at Farmer Green's place to-morrow. And if I were you I should certainly
want to be there."</p>

<p>Being very good-natured, Jimmy Rabbit was always ready to talk to
anybody he happened to meet, no matter how small the other person might
be. And now, while he was nibbling at Farmer Green's lettuce, he had
chanced to glance up and spy Buster Bumblebee, who was buzzing about the
tall hollyhocks, which made a sort of hedge where the flower and the
vegetable garden met.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"A raising bee!" Buster Bumblebee exclaimed, when he heard Jimmy
Rabbit's bit of news. "I've never in my life seen that kind of bee&mdash;nor
heard of it, either.... It must be a great curiosity."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Jimmy Rabbit. "And you ought not to miss seeing this one.
I'd like to go over to the farmhouse to-morrow myself&mdash;if I had the
time."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going, anyhow," Buster declared. "And when next I see you
I'll tell you all about this strange bee. For all we know now it may be
nothing but a honey bee that has changed his name."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit only smiled at his small friend. He said nothing at
all&mdash;though he looked uncommonly wise.</p>

<p>"What time to-morrow can I get a peep at this 'raising bee,' as he calls
himself?" Buster Bumblebee inquired.</p>

<p>"You had better plan to reach the farmyard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> at nine o'clock sharp,"
Jimmy Rabbit advised him.</p>

<p>"How shall I know where to look?" Buster asked him.</p>

<p>"Oh! you'll have no trouble finding the raising bee," Jimmy replied.
"Just follow the crowd! All of Farmer Green's friends for miles around
will be there."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Buster. "What are they coming for?"</p>

<p>"Why, they've heard about the raising bee, too," Jimmy told him. "Farmer
Green has invited everybody to come to his house. And there'll be plenty
to eat for everyone. No doubt they'll have a dance, too, in the
afternoon&mdash;just before milking time. Of course they'll all have to go
home in time to milk the cows," Jimmy explained.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Buster remarked. "And I must say I'm glad that I have no
cows,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> for it has always seemed to me that they are only a nuisance."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit agreed heartily in that opinion.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Buster Bumblebee continued. "Farmer Green has many strange ways.
Now, what's the sense of having a vegetable garden? And yet I understand
that he always plants one over there where you're sitting."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't quite agree with you," he said quickly, "though I've always
claimed that a flower garden is just a waste of time."</p>

<p>"What a strange notion!" cried Buster Bumblebee. "To my way of thinking,
this flower garden is the best thing Farmer Green has&mdash;unless it's the
clover patch."</p>

<p>Now, some people would have flown into a temper at once on being
disputed like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> that. But Jimmy Rabbit was never known to be angry.</p>

<p>"Billy Woodchuck would agree with you about the clover," he said with a
chuckle. "You know he's very fond of clover-tops."</p>

<p>"He's a sensible chap," Buster Bumblebee declared. "And speaking of
clover makes me so hungry for some that I'm going to the clover patch
this very minute."</p>

<p>So Buster darted away, calling out as he went that he would meet Jimmy
at the hollyhock hedge on the next morning but one.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you all about the raising bee," he promised once more.</p>

<p>And Jimmy Rabbit laughed so heartily that he almost choked over a choice
lettuce leaf.</p>

<h2>XVIII<br/>FOLLOWING THE CROWD</h2>
</div>

<p>Well, the next day Buster Bumblebee arrived at Farmer Green's place just
as the cuckoo clock in the kitchen was striking nine. And he knew at
once that Jimmy Rabbit must have told him the truth about the raising
bee, for the farmyard was crowded with wagons and carryalls and buggies
and gigs. There were people everywhere&mdash;so many that Buster thought all
the world must be there. And he began to look about him carefully.</p>

<p>But nowhere could he find what he had come to see. So he asked a
ruffianly looking wasp where the raising bee was. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> the wasp, who was
hurrying by, merely glanced at Buster and said, with a frown:</p>

<p>"Follow the crowd!"</p>

<p>Buster remembered then that that was exactly what Jimmy Rabbit had told
him to do. And now, as he looked all around, he noticed that Farmer
Green was already leading the way to a pile of lumber near the old
cow-barn. Everybody was following him. And a good many small boys began
to shout to nobody in particular, "Hurrah! hurrah! She's going up!"</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee hastened to overtake the crowd.</p>

<p>"They must mean the raising bee," he said to himself. "And from what
those boys are saying I gather that it's a <i>lady</i> raising bee and she's
going to fly for the company."</p>

<p>In his eagerness to see everything that was happening, Buster buzzed
very close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> to a good many people. And though most of them paid little
heed to him, there was one boy who slapped at him with his hat&mdash;and all
but hit him, too.</p>

<p>After that Buster was more careful. He flew higher. And at last he found
a fine seat on a tall sunflower, from which he could view every move
that was made.</p>

<p>Farmer Green's guests&mdash;that is, the <i>men</i>, for the women had not left
the house&mdash;the guests all took off their coats and began to arrange
themselves around some huge timbers that lay upon the ground. And a
great shouting arose. Everybody seemed to be talking at once. And the
small boys were everywhere, chasing one another about and getting in
everyone's way.</p>

<p>Then all was quiet for a few minutes while Farmer Green said something
to the men. And as soon as he had stopped talking some of the men began
to lift a sort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> of framework of wood into the air. When they had raised
it exactly as Farmer Green wanted it other men began to pound about the
foot of it with hammers. But Buster Bumblebee&mdash;though he watched
everything very closely&mdash;hadn't the slightest idea what they were doing.</p>

<p>"Hi, there!" he called to old dog Spot. "Where's the raising bee?"</p>

<p>Old Spot promptly looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," he replied. "I don't know
anything about any bee. And I wish you wouldn't trouble me with your
silly questions. These men are helping us to build our new barn; and I'm
too busy to talk to anyone."</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee was certainly disappointed. And he soon decided that
Jimmy Rabbit must have been mistaken. It wasn't the raising bee, after
all, that had brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> all the neighbors together there. They had come
to help Farmer Green with his new barn! Old dog Spot had said so. And he
ought to know, if anyone did.</p>

<h2>XIX<br/>THE FEAST AT FARMER GREEN'S</h2>
</div>

<p>In spite of his disappointment at not seeing the raising bee (that new
kind of bee that Jimmy Rabbit had told him about) Buster Bumblebee
decided that he would stay at Farmer Green's place and watch the men put
up the frame of the new barn. He remembered that Jimmy had said there
would be things to eat afterwards&mdash;and maybe a dance, besides.</p>

<p>Although the barn was a big one there were so many people to help that
it was hardly later than midday when the great timbers were all in
place. And then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> men caught up their coats and strolled back to the
dooryard. The small boys had all hurried ahead of them as soon as they
noticed that the women and girls were already setting generous dishes of
goodies upon long tables beneath the shade of the maple trees in front
of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>And when he saw what was going on Buster Bumblebee hastened to the maple
grove too. He intended to taste of every kind of food that was there, in
the hope of finding some dainty that he would like.</p>

<p>So for some time he busied himself buzzing up and down the long table,
alighting on heaps of doughnuts and cookies, pies, cakes, bread and
butter, baked beans and ever so many other good things.</p>

<p>But Buster Bumblebee did not find anything that really pleased him until
he paused at a fat sugar-bowl. Since the sugar was sweet he couldn't
help liking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> that, though it did seem somewhat tasteless to him after
his feasts among the clover-tops.</p>

<p>"This is the only food here that's worth eating," he remarked to
himself, "though perhaps the cake would not be bad, once a person
learned to like it."</p>

<p>Luckily Buster had time to make a hearty meal off the sugar before a
red-cheeked girl shooed him away. And then Farmer Green and all his
friends sat down at the long tables.</p>

<p>How they did eat! They began with pie. And Buster Bumblebee, flying
lazily above their heads, noticed with amazement the enormous pieces
that disappeared into the mouths of men, women and children. One
mouthful such as they took would have fed him at least a month. And
there was one boy called Bill who stowed away enough each time his fork
traveled to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> mouth to nourish Buster Bumblebee a whole summer.</p>

<p>"That boy is making a pig of himself!" Buster Bumblebee exclaimed, right
out loud. But since nobody understood what he said, no one paid any
attention to his remark. "You'll be ill, if you're not careful," Buster
buzzed right in the greedy boy's ear.</p>

<p>But the youngster known as Bill only moved his head slightly. And to
Buster's alarm he continued to bolt huge mouthfuls of everything within
his reach.</p>

<p>It was really a terrible sight. Buster Bumblebee was so fascinated by it
that he sat right down on a low-hanging maple bough and kept his eyes
fixed on that marvellous boy.</p>

<p>Before the feast came to an end the boy Bill's face underwent an odd
change. In the beginning it had worn a wide smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> But at last Buster
saw a look of pain steal over Bill's somewhat besmeared features. And
beneath his coating of tan he seemed to have grown pale.</p>

<p>Before long Buster was sure he heard a groan, though no one of the
merrymakers paid the slightest heed to it. Everyone was too busy eating
and talking with his neighbors to notice Bill's distress.</p>

<p>Then came another groan&mdash;and another&mdash;and another&mdash;and another, until
finally greedy Bill clapped both his hands across the front of his
jacket and let out a terrific roar.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Buster Bumblebee. "You have a stomachache, young man. And
it's no wonder."</p>


<hr class="major" />
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;'>
<a name="r8234" id="r8234"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<h2>XX<br/>BUSTER AND THE FIDDLERS</h2>
</div>

<p>There was a great rattling of knives and forks dropped suddenly upon
plates and a clatter of cups set hastily upon saucers. For when the boy
with the stomachache screamed aloud in his agony all of Farmer Green's
guests turned towards him to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee saw a large woman dressed in bright red rush up to the
boy Bill and lead him away towards the farmhouse, quite doubled up with
pain.</p>

<p>"That's his mother!" Buster decided. "And it's lucky for him that she's
here."</p>

<p>Everybody else seemed to think likewise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> And no one appeared much
worried. At least, all the company fell upon the feast once more. And in
a surprisingly short time everything but the dishes had vanished.</p>

<p>Still the people lingered there and talked&mdash;or the grown-ups did, anyhow
(of course the boys and girls didn't want to sit at a table after the
good things had all been eaten off it). And Buster Bumblebee had just
made up his mind that the whole affair was very dull! Yes! he had begun
to wish he had not wasted his time at Farmer Green's party, when
suddenly he heard something that sent a tingle all through him.</p>

<p>It was a most delightful sound. And noticing that the people were
leaving the scene of the banquet, Buster again recalled Jimmy Rabbit's
advice to "follow the crowd." So he found himself shortly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> in the
carriage-house, from which everything on wheels had been run outside
into the farmyard.</p>

<p>At one side of the great square room sat three men, each holding a queer
wooden object, upon which he sawed busily without appearing to cut
anything. And Buster soon learned that the bewitching sound came from
the sawing.</p>

<p>"How do you like the music?" said a voice in Buster's ear. He turned
quickly. And he saw then that old dog Spot had followed the crowd too
and was sitting in the doorway, where everyone had to walk around him.
He seemed to be enjoying himself. And he kept thumping the floor with
his tail as if he were trying to keep time with the tune.</p>

<p>"The music is beautiful," Buster Bumblebee said in reply to Spot's
question. "But there's something I don't quite understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> I've seen
men sawing wood before, but they made no such sound as this."</p>

<p>Old dog Spot couldn't help smiling the least bit.</p>

<p>"Why, those men aren't sawing wood. They're <i>fiddling</i>," he explained;
"three fiddlers fiddling upon fiddles.... There's going to be a dance,
you know," old dog Spot continued. "And of course nobody cares to dance
without music."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly not!" Buster Bumblebee agreed. And he began to be glad he
had come to the farmyard, after all. You see, he was fond of music and
dancing. And he thought the music played by the three fiddlers was too
wonderful for words.</p>

<p>Soon the floor was crowded with merry people who bowed and scraped to
one another and danced breakdowns and cut pigeon-wings and other capers,
while Buster Bumblebee flitted gaily about just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> above their bobbing
heads, trying his best to keep time to the music and wishing that he had
brought some of his friends along with him to Farmer Green's party.</p>

<p>As for the raising bee, Buster had completely forgotten it. He was
having so much fun at the dance that the real reason for his coming to
Farmer Green's place had quite slipped out of his mind.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
<h2>XXI<br/>THE BUMBLEBEE IN THE PUMPKIN</h2>
</div>

<p>Of course the dancers at Farmer Green's party had to stop now and then
to get their breath. And the fiddlers, too, had to pause in order to
rest. That is, two of them found it necessary to lay their fiddles aside
once in a while. And it was no wonder; for they had each eaten a whole
custard pie.</p>

<p>But the third fiddler was different. He was a man after Buster
Bumblebee's own heart. He seemed to love to make music and never tired
of coaxing the jolliest tunes out of his old fiddle that anybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> could
hope to hear. <i>He</i> only laughed when his fellow fiddlers lay back in
their chairs and mopped their red faces. And just to keep the company in
good spirits&mdash;and because he couldn't help it&mdash;this frolicsome fiddler
would start right ahead and play something that was sure to set a body's
feet a-going and make him feel so happy that he would want to shout
right out&mdash;good and loud.</p>

<p>Whenever this merry musician played all alone like that Buster Bumblebee
stayed close by him in order to hear better. And so it was that Buster
at last met with a surprise. He was bobbing about with a great deal of
pleasure to the strains of a lively tune when he heard something that
made him settle quickly upon a beam above the jolly fiddler's head.</p>

<p>He wanted to sit still and listen. (Somehow he always had to buzz more
or less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> when he was flying.) Yes! he wanted to listen closely because
he was almost certain that he heard the buzzing of a strange bee. And
the sound seemed to come right out of the fiddle!</p>

<p>From his seat on the beam Buster Bumblebee looked down at the fiddle,
upon which the fiddler was scraping away at a great rate; and he noticed
then that there were two openings in it through which a bee might crawl
with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>"That's it!" Buster Bumblebee shouted right out loud. "The bee's inside
the fiddle.... I don't believe the fiddler knows it!" he chuckled.</p>

<p>And then another idea came into Buster's head. He wondered if that bee
was not the raising bee, which he had gone to so much trouble to see and
which he had almost given up finding.</p>

<p>Then, happening to glance about him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> Buster noticed that many of the
people in the place were smiling at one another and nodding their heads
wisely, as if to say: "There's the bee! Do you hear him buzz?"</p>

<p>And old dog Spot, who still sat in the doorway, seemed to be smiling,
too. Anyhow, his jaws were open so wide that his tongue was hanging out
of his mouth.</p>

<p>Feeling very wise himself, Buster Bumblebee bustled over to the doorway
and said to old Spot:</p>

<p>"Do you hear that bee? He's inside the fiddle!"</p>

<p>Then old Spot actually laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," he replied. "That's the bumblebee in the pumpkin."</p>

<p>"Bumblebee!" Buster cried. "Pardon me&mdash;but you are mistaken yourself.
That's no bumblebee. No member of my family ever buzzed like that.... It
must be a raising bee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps you know best," said old Spot. "But the people here all say
it's a bumblebee&mdash;in a pumpkin."</p>

<p>"What pumpkin?" Buster wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Well, that one&mdash;I suppose," old dog Spot told him, cocking an eye and
an ear towards a big yellow pumpkin, which someone had set on a wide
shelf on the wall.</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee looked at the pumpkin. And then he darted straight to
it. If there was a bee of any kind inside it, making that strange
buzzing, he intended to have a good look at him.</p>


<hr class="major" />
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;'>
<a name="r3195" id="r3195"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
<h2>XXII<br/>SOMEONE'S MISTAKE</h2>
</div>

<p>Though he alighted right on top of the pumpkin, which stood on the wide
shelf in Farmer Green's carriage-house, Buster Bumblebee thought that
the strange buzzing sound had grown fainter. He was sure that he had
heard it more plainly when he was nearer the merry fiddler.</p>

<p>There was a gouge in the side of the fat pumpkin, into which he peered
carefully. He even crawled into the small cavity himself. But there was
nothing there. And he decided, after thinking deeply for some time, that
there could not possibly be a bee inside the pumpkin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he had made up his mind on that point Buster Bumblebee
blustered back to old dog Spot once more.</p>

<p>"You're certainly wrong!" he exclaimed. "There's no bumblebee&mdash;nor any
other sort of bee&mdash;anywhere near the pumpkin."</p>

<p>"There was one there only a moment ago," old Spot remarked with a sly
smile.</p>

<p>"I didn't see him," said Buster Bumblebee, looking much puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> did," old Spot replied. "And that proves that I'm right."</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee could think of no good retort to make at that moment.
And since the odd buzzing had stopped, and all three fiddlers were
tuning up for more dance music, in his excitement Buster forgot all
about the raising bee again, the bumblebee in the pumpkin, and even his
dispute with old dog Spot.</p>

<p>So the dance went on. And at last, late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> in the afternoon, the people
suddenly remembered that they had to go home to milk the cows. Then the
fiddlers put away their fiddles; for the dance had come to an end. And
Buster Bumblebee was extremely sorry that it was so.</p>

<p>Now, Jimmy Rabbit had agreed to meet Buster at the hollyhock hedge
between the flower and the vegetable garden, on the morning following
the great gathering of Farmer Green's friends. At least, that was what
Buster Bumblebee thought.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the matter had slipped entirely from Jimmy
Rabbit's mind. And although Buster went to the meeting-place each
morning, he failed to find his long-eared friend there.</p>

<p>Luckily it was a pleasant spot in which to wait. So each day Buster
breakfasted upon the flowers. And if it hadn't been for just one thing
he wouldn't have cared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> much whether Jimmy Rabbit ever came back to meet
him or not. But Buster did want to tell Jimmy Rabbit that he had been
mistaken about the raising bee. Jimmy Rabbit knew so much&mdash;he was always
explaining things to people with such a knowing air&mdash;that Buster
Bumblebee thought it would do Jimmy a world of good to understand that
for once he was wrong.</p>

<p>If Buster had only visited the garden earlier in the morning he would
have found Jimmy Rabbit easily enough. But Buster did not like to go
abroad much until the sun had had a chance to dry the dew, for it was
hard for him to fly when his wings were wet.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Jimmy Rabbit usually went to the garden at dawn,
because he had an idea that lettuce was crisper and tasted better while
the cool dew still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> clung to it. But at last there came a morning when
Jimmy was so late and Buster was so early in reaching the garden that
their breakfast hours came at the same time.</p>

<h2>XXIII<br/>MAKING GAME OF OLD DOG SPOT</h2>
</div>

<p>"Where have you been keeping yourself?" Buster Bumblebee cried, the
moment he caught sight of Jimmy Rabbit's ears sticking up from behind a
head of Farmer Green's lettuce. "It's quite plain that you forgot to
meet me, so I might tell you about the raising bee."</p>

<p>At that Jimmy Rabbit promptly replied that he had come there each
morning.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he said, "you promised to meet me. And since you haven't met
me until now it must be your fault, for you certainly haven't done as
you agreed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee looked puzzled. He was sure that the fault had not been
his. But his wits were not so nimble as Jimmy Rabbit's. And he could
think of no answer at all.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you know about the raising bee?" Jimmy asked him with an
encouraging smile.</p>

<p>"You were mistaken about that," Buster told him eagerly. "There wasn't
any raising bee. Farmer Green's neighbors for miles around came to help
him put up the frame of his new barn. And afterwards they enjoyed a
feast under the trees&mdash;and a dance."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit began to shake in a very strange manner.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" he cried in a jolly voice. "You are the one that's
mistaken&mdash;and not I! You saw a raising bee and didn't know it! Farmer
Green's friends <i>raised</i> the timbers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> for the barn. And that's why it's
called a <i>raising</i> bee. Any helpful, neighborly gathering like that is
known as a <i>bee</i>&mdash;though you may not be aware of that fact."</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee stared open-mouthed. He had never suspected such a
thing. But Jimmy Rabbit said it was so. And there was nothing to do but
believe him.</p>

<p>"So they had something to eat&mdash;and a dance too, eh?" said Jimmy Rabbit
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Buster, "and there was a bumblebee in a pumpkin, though I
couldn't see him. But old dog Spot said he did. And I suppose I was
mistaken, for I thought he was inside a fiddle."</p>

<p>And now Jimmy Rabbit was laughing again, holding his sides and shaking
so hard that it seemed as if his ears would fall off if he didn't stop
soon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you were not mistaken at all!" he cried, as soon as he could speak
again. "That's an old, old tune. My grandfather has hummed it to me many
a time. He used to say that there never was another tune just like it."</p>

<p>"What tune?" Buster Bumblebee asked him. "I must say I don't know what
you're talking about."</p>

<p>"Why, <i>The Bumblebee in the Pumpkin</i>!" Jimmy Rabbit informed him.
"That's the name of a tune. Every good fiddler knows it. And since the
buzzing sound comes out of the fiddle, the bumblebee must be inside it,
of course."</p>

<p>For a moment Buster looked almost peevish. He had intended to take Jimmy
Rabbit down a peg by telling him he had been mistaken. And here was
Jimmy Rabbit, explaining every strange thing, just as he always did! It
was most annoying&mdash;so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> Buster thought. But all at once a comforting idea
popped into his head.</p>

<p>"Old dog Spot was wrong, wasn't he?" Buster cried.</p>

<p>"He certainly was," Jimmy Rabbit replied.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Buster Bumblebee. "Isn't it odd how stupid some people
are?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is!" said Jimmy Rabbit. And for some unknown reason he
laughed harder than ever before.</p>

<p>But Buster Bumblebee did not mind that in the least. He thought that
Jimmy Rabbit was making game of old dog Spot.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
